Gmail labels. By tagging posts with one or more\nkeyword, you can organise articles into buckets of related content.\n\nWhen you create content for your publication you can assign tags to help\ndifferentiate between categories of content. \n\nFor example you may tag some content with News and other content with Podcast,\nwhich would create two distinct categories of content listed on /tag/news/ and \n/tag/podcast/, respectively.\n\nIf you tag a post with both News and Podcast - then it appears in both sections.\nTag archives are like dedicated home-pages for each category of content that you\nhave. They have their own pages, their own RSS feeds, and can support their own\ncover images and meta data.\n\nThe primary tag\nInside the Ghost editor, you can drag and drop tags into a specific order. The\nfirst tag in the list is always given the most importance, and some themes will\nonly display the primary tag (the first tag in the list) by default. \n\n> News, Technology, Startup\nSo you can add the most important tag which you want to show up in your theme,\nbut also add related tags which are less important.\n\nPrivate tags\nSometimes you may want to assign a post a specific tag, but you don't\nnecessarily want that tag appearing in the theme or creating an archive page. In\nGhost, hashtags are private and can be used for special styling.\n\nFor example, if you sometimes publish posts with video content - you might want\nyour theme to adapt and get rid of the sidebar for these posts, to give more\nspace for an embedded video to fill the screen. In this case, you could use\nprivate tags to tell your theme what to do.\n\n> News, #video\nHere, the theme would assign the post publicly displayed tags of News - but it\nwould also keep a private record of the post being tagged with #video. In your\ntheme, you could then look for private tags conditionally and give them special\nformatting. \n\n> You can find documentation for theme development techniques like this and many\nmore over on Ghost's extensive theme docs\n[https://ghost.org/docs/api/handlebars-themes/].\nDynamic routing\nDynamic routing gives you the ultimate freedom to build a custom publication to\nsuit your needs.

It's also possible to use multiple templates in your theme\nto render each content type differently.\n\nThere are lots of use cases for dynamic routing with Ghost, here are a few\ncommon examples: \n\n * Setting a custom home page with its own template\n * Having separate content hubs for blog and podcast, that render differently,\n   and have custom RSS feeds to support two types of content\n * Creating a founders column as a unique view, by filtering content created by\n   specific authors\n * Including dates in permalinks for your posts\n * Setting posts to have a URL relative to their primary tag like \n   example.com/europe/story-title/\n   \n\n> Dynamic routing can be configured in Ghost using YAML\n[http://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html] files.
