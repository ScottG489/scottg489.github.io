## üèÅ Getting Started

1. Install this starter by running

    ```bash
    gatsby new try-ghost https://github.com/styxlab/gatsby-starter-try-ghost
    ```

2. Change directory

    ```bash
    cd try-ghost
    ```

3. Run

    ```bash
    gatsby develop
    ```
    and visit your site at `http://localhost:8000`.
    
&nbsp;

## üí° Configure

```js
    //siteConfig.js
    module.exports = {
        // Do not include a trailing slash!
        siteUrl: `https://your-blog.com`,

        // Maximum number of post shown per page
        // Infinite Scroll: Initial chunk of posts, subsequent posts are fetched one by one
        postsPerPage: 3, 
    
        // This allows an alternative site title for meta data for pages.
        siteTitleMeta: `Gatsby Starter Ghost CMS`, 

        // This allows an site description for meta data for pages.
        siteDescriptionMeta: `Turn your Ghost blog into a flaring fast static site with Gatsby`, 
    
        // Used for App and Offline manifest e.g. Mobile Home Screen
        shortTitle: `Ghost`, 
        siteIcon: `favicon.png`, 
        backgroundColor: `#e9e9e9`,
        themeColor: `#15171A`,

        // Include Gatsby images for lazy loading and image optimizations (default: true)
        gatsbyImages: true,

        // Overwrite navigation menu (default: []), label is case sensitive
        // overwriteGhostNavigation: [{ label: `Home`, url: `/` }],
    }
```

In the configuration shown above, the most important fields to be changed are `siteUrl`, `siteTitleMeta` and `siteDescriptionMeta`. Update at least those to fit your needs.

## üîë Ghost Content API keys

All content is sourced from a Ghost CMS. By default, content is fetched from the demo location at `https://cms.gotsby.org`. Surely you want to source your own content. There are two ways to make your content keys available. Choose the method according to your build scenario.

### Building with cloud providers

If you build your project with a cloud provider (e.g. Gatsby, Netlify, Vercel), the best option is to provide the keys with environment variables:

| Key | Value (example) |
| ----| ----- |
| GHOST_API_URL | http:\/\/localhost:2368 |
| GHOST_CONTENT_API_KEY | 9fccdb0e4ea5b572e2e5b92942 |

The place where you can define them depends on the provider, but you usually find the option under the site settings. This avoids publishing keys in a public repository and is most secure.

### Building locally

If you build locally or on a private network where the build directory is not accessible to the world, you can safely add a new `.ghost.json` file in your base directory with the following JSON structure:

```bash

    {
        "development": {
            "apiUrl": "http://localhost:2368",
            "contentApiKey": "9fccdb0e4ea5b572e2e5b92942"
        },
        "production": {
            "apiUrl": "http://localhost:2368",
            "contentApiKey": "9fccdb0e4ea5b572e2e5b92942"
        }
    }
```

This file is part of `.gitignore` to avoid accidentally publishing it to your public repository. Change the `apiUrl` and `contentApiKey` to match your own Ghost CMS Content API keys.

&nbsp;

## ü§Ø Ensure headless mode of Ghost CMS

For best SEO results it is strongly recommended to disable the default Ghost Handlebars theme front-end by selecting the *Make this site private* flag within your Ghost admin settings. This enables password protection in front of the Ghost install and sets `<meta name="robots" content="noindex" />` so your Gatsby front-end becomes the authoritative source for search engines.
