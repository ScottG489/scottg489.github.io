# GitHub profile page

The GitHub profile page README is a bit of an Easter egg. It doesn't seem to have ever been officially announced
although it is [fully documented](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/managing-your-profile-readme).
It appears to have been released sometime around July 2020.

If you'd like to set this up for your own profile simply
1. Create a repo with the same name as your username
2. Create a README.md file in that repo
3. Put some content in it!

The README will then appear at the top of your profile page.

This is my GitHub profile README at the time of writing:

![Top Languages](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/top-langs/?username=scottg489&cache_seconds=1800&hide=python)
