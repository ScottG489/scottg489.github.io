# Initial thoughts

I'm finally at the point where I'm happy (enough) with the website's look to start adding content to it.
Although there are still a few things I'd still like to smooth over, and some functional issues I'd like to fix
(e.g. social icons not appearing on mobile), I think it looks pretty good.
That said, I'm not sure how I feel about the theme and overall look of the site. 
It's elegant while not being too over the top, but I think a more <small>minimalistic</small>
and <samp>simplistic</samp> look might better reflect my style.

While I was working on this site I found myself frequently referring to my friend [Michael Pobega's site](https://pobe.ga/posts/).
Although his site may be more minimalistic than what I'm looking for, I did like the theme's conciseness.

For my site, I was able to water down the [original theme](https://github.com/scttcper/gatsby-casper/) and make
it more simplified and compact. It felt a bit too **_in-your-face_** with everything so spaced apart and oversized.
The original theme also had features like support for multiple authors and "author pages" which I don't need since I'll
be the only author.

I'm split between the site looking attractive yet simple.

So I think I'll keep the look for now and see if it grows on me.
In the meantime I still plan on adding content and features to the site as is.
A few of the next things I have planned are:
- Add my resume ✓
- Create a separate project and post page and change the path structure accordingly ✓
- Add more social icons/links ✓
- Write up my "about" page
- Add more projects
- Public/private dashboards for various things I'd like to see all in one place (stretch goal)

...and of course I also plan on adding more posts :)
